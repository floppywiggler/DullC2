This repo is entirely for educational purposes and should not be used by anyone. However you are free to use the code for whatever you'd like of course.

I've been following RastaMouse and his series on `SharpC2`, and in an effort to improve my C# coding skills I've decided to follow along and hopefully learn something along the way.

All credits goes to RastaMouse for this, please support him on his own channels.
